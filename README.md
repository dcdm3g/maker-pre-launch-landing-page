# Maker Pre-launch Landing Page

![Development status badge.](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-DEVELOPMENT-3EE9E5?labelColor=080C20)

This is my solution to the ["Maker pre-launch landing page" challenge by Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/maker-prelaunch-landing-page-WVZIJtKLd). Therefore, Maker is not a real company or organization.

## Running The Project 🏃

To run the project, you need to have Node.js and Git installed on your machine. You can install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

First, navigate to the folder where you want to keep the project folder. Then clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/davi-costa-de-melo/maker-pre-launch-landing-page
```

Now that you have the project folder, navigate to it and install the dependencies:

```sh
cd maker-pre-launch-landing-page && npm install
```

Perfect! It's almost done! We just need to start Next.js in development mode with the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Everything is ready! The application will start at http://localhost:3000 by default. See [the Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more information.
